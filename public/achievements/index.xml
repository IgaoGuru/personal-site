      <description>Brief summary: Since the beggining of 2019, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on AI driven research projects.
Paulo Abelha, a PhD in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, is leading me through the reasearch process, while giving me mentorship and guidance for my research.
Currently , the main focus of the project revolves around applying artificial intelligence to video games. Making machines that can understand information presented on the screen, and provide accurate feedback regarding the position of targets.</description>

      <description>Bp Global STEM Academies - Egypt 2019 You can click here to see more photos!
Brief summary: In july 2019, I was awarded a one month full STEM scholarship in Cairo, Egypt, as part of a colaboration between AFS and BP. While there, I visited many universities and laboratories, while also taking classes in mathematics, physics and chemestry.
The program aims to select students between 15 and 17, who have great interest in STEM, and want to create impact in their communities, with interdisciplinary thinking.</description>

      <description>Brief summary: Throughout 2018 and 2019, I took advanced physics classes at my school.
We studied topics such as elemental particles, basics of particle acceleration, physics of light and other forms of radiation.
Many researchers also gave talks, as part of the program. Among them, were people from CBPF (Brazilian Center of Physics Research) and UFRJ (one of the most prestigious academic institutions in Brazil).
In 2019, as the culmination of the program, the study group visited CERN, the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest particle accelerator, in Switzerland.</description>

      <description>Brief summary: Since 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving private tutoring lessons on math, physics and chemestry to other students and peers. Also in 2018, I started teaching classes on these subjects, on school after-hours.
As my interest in teaching grew, I started to search for more opportunities to share and learn. In 2020, I started teaching math classes at a community driven non-profit organization, that helps students from lower socio-economic standpoits get into their desired universities, through extremely low-cost classes with volunteer teachers.</description>

      <description>Brief summary: While in Cairo (through AFS, in 2019), I also took a course on microbiology and water treatment cycles. The week-long program had us sleeping in the universitie&amp;rsquo;s dorms, and featured many interesting experiments and demonstrations. Many of the experiments were directly involved in the process of water treatment, like purification, ph treatments and others. Additionaly, we had lessons regarding virology and bacteriology, my favorite being the experiments with E.</description>
