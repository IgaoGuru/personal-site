<p>Since the beggining of 2019, I&rsquo;ve been working on AI driven research projects.</p>
<p>Paulo Abelha, a PhD in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, is leading me through the reasearch process, while giving me mentorship and guidance for my research.</p>
<p>Currently , the main focus of the project revolves around applying artificial intelligence to video games. Making machines that can understand information presented on the screen, and provide accurate feedback regarding the position of targets.</p>
<p>Apart from my current work with Paulo, I also completed a 4 month <a href="https://www.coursera.org/verify/TWM77P2FC5MV">online coursera Course</a> on Machine Learning, taught by PhD. Andrew Ng. The course is certified by Stanford University.</p>
