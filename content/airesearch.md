###  Brief summary:

Since the beggining of 2019, I've been working on AI driven research projects.

Paulo Abelha, a PhD in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, is leading me through the research process, mentoring me and giving me guidance.

Currently , the main focus of the project revolves around applying artificial intelligence to video games. Making machines that can understand information presented on the screen, and provide accurate feedback regarding the position of targets.

My current project is called **Sequoia**. It uses cutting-edge deep neural-networks to process realtime screenshots of the shooting game (CS:GO), and provide accurate mouse_movement response.

Apart from my current work with Paulo, I also completed a 4 month [online coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/verify/TWM77P2FC5MV) on Machine Learning, taught by PhD. Andrew Ng. The course is certified by Stanford University.
