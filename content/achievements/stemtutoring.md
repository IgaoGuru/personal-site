###  Brief summary:

Since 2018, I've been giving private tutoring lessons on math, physics and chemestry to other students and peers.
Also in 2018, I started teaching classes on these subjects, on school after-hours.

As my interest in teaching grew, I started to search for more opportunities to share and learn. In 2020, I started teaching math classes at a community driven non-profit organization, that helps students from lower socio-economic standpoits get into their desired universities, through extremely low-cost classes with volunteer teachers. Because of Covid-19, the presential classes have been temporarely suspended, but I'm still giving free online classes to those who can attend, and plan to teach as a volunteer as soon as the regular classes resume!
