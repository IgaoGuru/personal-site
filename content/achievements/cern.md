###  Brief summary:
Throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020, I took advanced physics classes at my school.

We studied topics such as elemental particles, basics of particle acceleration, physics of light and other forms of radiation.

Many researchers also gave talks, as part of the program. 
Among them, were people from CBPF (Brazilian Center of Physics Research) and UFRJ (one of the most prestigious academic institutions in Brazil).

In 2019, as the culmination of the program, the study group visited CERN, the world's biggest particle accelerator, in Switzerland. We stayed four days in the facility, attending talks and meeting researchers.  

While there, one of my favorite moments by far was when we found John Ellis, a maxwell medal winning physicist, in the cafeteria! We took photos with him, and he sent a message to the people in Brazil.
