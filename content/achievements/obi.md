###  Brief summary:

Throughout 2020, I competed in all phases of **[OBI](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br)**, Brazil's National Olympiad in Informatics.

As the results for the finalist phase have yet to annouced, the certificates too are not yet available - and will be displayed in the [awards and certificates](/awards/) page once they are released.
