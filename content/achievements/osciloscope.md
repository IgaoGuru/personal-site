In the end of 2019, I got to talk a bit about two topics that are very dear to me. Physics, and music. Through the lens of "Osciloscope Music", I present many different physics concepts in acoustics, while weaving the narrative around fun drawings and music history.
Although the talk was given in Brazilian Portuguese, there are subtitles available.

Some of the topics and questions covered in the video:

* Sound wave representations beyond sine function drawings
* What even is osciloscope music?
* The psychological and neurological roots of consonance and dissonance
* Mathematical representations of dissonance, and it's fundamental role in music
* How were the 12 western music notes created?
* What's the maths behind creating 3d sound waves?
