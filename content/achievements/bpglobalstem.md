###  Brief summary:

In july 2019, I was awarded a one month full STEM scholarship in Cairo, Egypt, as part of a colaboration between AFS and BP. While there, I visited many universities and laboratories, while also taking classes in mathematics, physics and chemestry.

The program aims to select students between 15 and 17, who have great interest in STEM, and want to create impact in their communities, with interdisciplinary thinking.
I stayed in Cairo for a month, with a volunteer Family.
