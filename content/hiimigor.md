I'm a 16 year old brazilian student who's very interested in maths, computers, and artificial intelligence!

I hope this site gives you an idea of who I am, not only academically, but also as a person. Below, you can find some of my values and beliefs.

* Work with people I believe in, promoting diversity in ideas and opinions, including ones I disagree with.

* Always be open to change my mind and accept new points of view. Be humble, and aware of my position. 

* Continue learning, both in and out of academia.

These are closely linked with what I want to pursue in my life,

My native language is **Portuguese**, but I love learning new languages. I speak fluent **English**, and I'm currently learning **Mandarin** and **German**.
